## Thank You (from) New York!

Iâ€™ve just wrapped up my sessions in New York, and I want to thank everyone who joined, asked great questions, and shared their insights.  
It was an amazing experience to connect with the community in person.

Presentations and demos aren in the subfolders

ðŸ™Œ Thanks again for the support, and I hope these resources help you in your own work and learning!
