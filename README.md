# README.md

## Introduction

This repository contains slide decks and other material from my public speaking engagements. Each folder corresponds to a specific event where I presented. For an up-to-date list of my sessions, see [my Sessionize page](https://sessionize.com/Tonie).


Welcome to the Tonies Presentations Repository!

In this repository, you will find all the presentations that have been shared and discussed within our organization. I apologize for not publishing them earlier, but all the content is now available for your reference and use.

## Contents

The repository includes a variety of presentation, that I should have uploaded earlier, sorry ;-)

## How to Use

Each folder within the repository is dedicated to a specific presentation.  
The folder name is built like `<YYYY-MM-DD> <Presentation> - <Location>`  

Inside each folder, you will find:

- The presentation slides in PDF format.
- (optional) Any supplementary materials or documentation referenced in the presentation.
- (optional) A README file providing an overview and key takeaways from the presentation.

## Getting Started

To view a presentation:

1. Navigate to the folder of the presentation you are interested in.
2. Open the PDF file to view the slides.
3. Refer to the README file in the folder for a summary and additional context.
