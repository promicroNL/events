## Session overview

DataMinds Connect is a three‑day, in‑person conference centred around the Microsoft Data Platform and AI.  
The 2025 edition runs from 6–8 October at the Lamot Conference & Heritage Center in Mechelen【355463505209809†L16-L53】.  
On 7 October I team up with Peter Kruis to show how to build a test database that doesn’t “suck.”  
We demonstrate how to create a database that mirrors production while remaining safe to share with colleagues.  
Using Flyway migrations and Azure DevOps pipelines we build, seed and refresh a test database rapidly, ensuring that developers can experiment without harming production.  
Our session shows how row‑level security, test‑data generation and repeatable workflows help deliver reliable databases that developers love.
